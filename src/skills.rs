//! Native Tina4 AI-skills installer.
//!
//! This replaces the old shell-out. The client used to download
//! `install-skills.sh` / `install-skills.ps1` and run it — on Windows as
//! `powershell -Command "iex ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllText('<downloaded .ps1>'))"`.
//! A freshly-updated, low-reputation `tina4.exe` spawning PowerShell to `iex`
//! a just-downloaded script is exactly the shape Windows Defender / Attack
//! Surface Reduction blocks: a real `tina4 update` came back with
//! `os error 225` (ERROR_VIRUS_INFECTED) and installed no skills. The binary is
//! EV-signed and fine; the spawn was the problem.
//!
//! So the whole installer now runs in-process. It fetches each skill file with
//! the CLI's own download primitive (`crate::download_file_classified`),
//! verifies every file against the published `skills.sha256` manifest with
//! `ring`'s SHA-256, and writes the files into the target directories itself.
//! No `powershell`, no `sh`, no `cmd`, no `iex`, no `install-skills.*` — this
//! module spawns no process of its own (the download primitive it calls prefers
//! `curl`/`curl.exe`, the same one `tina4 update` already uses to fetch its own
//! binary, which Defender does not object to).
//!
//! The behaviour is a faithful port of both scripts: same sources and fallback
//! order, same `TINA4_SKILLS_*` environment variables, same target directories,
//! the same checksum gate, and the same atomic publish. The one deliberate
//! difference is the dead-host optimisation: `download_file_classified` reports
//! an HTTP error without distinguishing 4xx from 5xx, so a host is written off
//! for the rest of the run only on a transport failure (no answer / DNS /
//! connect / TLS), while any HTTP error moves to the next source for that one
//! file. The set of files that land, and where, is identical.
